# /commit

Perform a git commit:

1. Run `git status` to review all changes in the repository.
2. Stage ALL changed and untracked files (not just files you touched — everything in the repo).
3. Write a concise commit message describing the changes. Follow the rules in `agent-rules/rules/git.md`.
4. Commit.
5. Do NOT push unless explicitly asked.
