# Git Rules

- Commits must include ALL changed files in the repository, not just files the current agent modified. Always stage everything before committing.
- Commit messages must never include agent co-authorship or attribution (no "Co-Authored-By" lines referencing AI agents, no "Generated by" footers, etc.).
- Write concise commit messages that describe what changed and why.
